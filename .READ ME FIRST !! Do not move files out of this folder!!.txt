Welcome - And thank you for buying.

I have designed this folder system in such a way that if you move any files, or rename any files - your going to run into trouble.




Extract the Folder in the .rar into your WRobot\Profiles\Quester Folder.


Correct Path should be -- WRobot\Profiles\Quester\1-60 REMAKE_Andoido



To Start the Profile:

1-60 Horde - REMAKE - 1 PROFILE_LAUNCHER.xml


This is going to be your Main loader - however you CAN, load the file individually if you like.

Each file will run, and complete. Once completed, it will then Re-Load the 1-60 Horde - REMAKE - 1 PROFILE_LAUNCHER.xml File, and move to the next Level Area.


Same with Class Quests. Once a class quest is completed - it will load 1-60 Horde - REMAKE - 1 PROFILE_LAUNCHER.xml.



Enjoy!
